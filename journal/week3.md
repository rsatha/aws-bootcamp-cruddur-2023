# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

The users can sign in directly with a username and password or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, or Apple. We will be working with one of its components known as user pool.

User pools are simply user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. Check out this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html) for better explanation of the service.
