### Install AWS CLI
I was able to install aws cli using the script added to gitpod.yml. 
Committed the code in the file gitpod.yml file.Initially made a mistake on the script and when i load the gitpod again, i noticed script is failing to install the aws. Then Fixed the issue and its working successfully .
Recommitted the code with the corrections.
Executed the cli command to verify the configuration completed.

### AWS Budget
I have created a buget for $1 .Since it is minimal value i have created single budget inorder to avoid cost for creating more than 2 budget.Since budget value is low did not create any threshold inbetween .
